A museum dedicated to minimalist creations, showcasing the smallest of websites, frameworks, and more.

## Websites

+   [Website Under 1kB](https://btxx.org/posts/1kb/)

    Bradley Taunt has crafted a personal resume that is less than 1 kB. Even without html, head, and body elements, it
    remains a valid HTML5 website.

+   The World's Shortest Domain

    `http://ai/` holds the title for the world's shortest domain. The .ai domain belongs to the British Overseas
    Territory of Anguilla, and according to ICANN, using top-level domains directly is not allowed. However, Anguilla has not adhered to this guideline.

    The ai domain is no longer in normal use, but you can visit the Internet Archive to view previous snapshots:

+   [htmz - a low power tool for html](https://leanrada.com/htmz/#examples)

    htmz is a minimalist HTML snippet that, with no external dependencies, achieves partial page content updates from
    other URLs when clicking links. It simulates functionality similar to XHR and AJAX.

## Multimedia

+   [The World's Smallest PNG](https://evanhahn.com/worlds-smallest-png/)

    Evan Hahn, following the PNG format specifications, has created the smallest PNG image, comprising only 67 bytes.
